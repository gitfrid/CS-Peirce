2026-01-17 16:20:16 | Running 3 independent inquiries to confirm reliability...
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | --- Run 1 ---
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | Limited to 100 prime pairs for large n=100000000 (reliability & memory safety)
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | Limited to 100 prime pairs for large n=100000000 (reliability & memory safety)
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | Algebraic Transcription (Hardy–Littlewood bound):
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | \frac{2 C n \prod_{p=3}^{\infty} \frac{p - 2}{p - 1}}{\log{\left(n \right)}^{2}} - \text{Error(RH)}
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | Alternative (Deuring–Heilbronn if RH false):
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | If RH false, Deuring–Heilbronn phenomenon creates stronger repulsion, ensuring G(n) > 0.
2026-01-17 16:20:16 | Weak generalization (avg prob 0.829, var 0.000, samples 8): Strong necessary conclusion: Goldbach holds with very high confidence.
