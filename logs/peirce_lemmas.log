             •  (1000000)

Interpretation: Lines of identity relate primes via + to 1000000.
Rule: Insert identity for symmetry if p=q.

  ≈ p ── ≤ n/2 ── Prime ── determines ── q = n − p ≈
  ≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈

Interpretation: Possibly, p determines q uniquely.
Rule: Replace binary relation with functional mapping.

Lemma 3 (Graph Notation):
No symmetry collapse: n/2 not prime.

Lemma 4 (Graph Notation):
Delta Tinctured Cut (green_causal for normative governance):

  ΔΔ [causal] 
  Δ If Beta graph verified, permit Gamma modal elevation to habit. Δ
  Δ No universal ∀ without inductive stability. Δ
  Δ Abstraction chains limited to observed relations. Δ
  ΔΔ

Interpretation: Delta governs inference: existential → modal → normative.
