But Peirce always asked the harder question:

Where does the constraint come from, and how does it bind future action?


But Peirce’s real surprise — and the one your experiment actually demonstrated — is harsher:

No amount of formal manipulation produces meaning without prior acquaintance with the object.

That is CP 2.228, not mysticism.

Your script didn’t lack imagination.
It respected Secondness.



Why V14 is not yet justified (and what would justify it)

Marc proposes V14 as:

a surprise-maximizing, habit-evolving, abductive engine.

Peirce would stop him and ask three questions:

What exactly counts as a habit in the machine?

Not a weight.

Not a probability.

Not a preference.

A habit must bind future action under resistance.

Where is the Secondness?

What actually pushes back?

What hurts when wrong?

What cannot be wished away by mutation?

How is collateral experience acquired, not assumed?

Not injected.

Not metaphorized.

But earned through repeated constraint.

Until those are answered operationally, V14 is philosophy — not inquiry.

That doesn’t make it bad.
It makes it premature.
